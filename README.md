# ICPMS-Data-Processor
Automates elemental data analysis.

The purpose of this script is to combine and process dataframes sourced from
excel spreadsheets of ICP-MS data that have been exported from Agilent's 
Masshunter software.

The first several steps of processing ICP-MS or other elemental data is performed
and a series of excel spreadsheets demonstrating the data transformations as well 
as a reporting/quantification limit chart and a separate spreadsheet of method 
blanks are returned.

Future versions will further automate QC validation and data processing.
